       <div id="identified"> a necessary evil </div>

       <li> <h3> 10:15 PM: </h3>
         The inevitable sugar crash happens. Sneak-eat fruit snacks in the aisles of Walmart. </li>

         <li> <h3> 11:00 PM: </h3>
           Emerge from Walmart with a fully restocked medical cabinet for all my hypochondriacal needs.

<div id="identified"> tbh i bought the menthol cough drops cuz i like how they taste </div>

      <div id="identified"> all it took was a ton of ASMR videos, the exhaustion of a family party, and a nice chili mac dinner.  </div>
